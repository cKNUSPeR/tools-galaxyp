	<description>
        Create a Calibrant Quality control reports for any kind of .imzML file.
        Supply a csv  file with Signals to visualize them and their accuracies
        Different metrics will be visualized as a pdf report.

        @I2NCA_DESCRIPTION@
    
        This tool performs a quality control report generation on any imzml file. 
        In the report, different metrics will be visualized. This report doesn't require any input other that a dataset.
    
        **Input data**
        
    
        @MSIDATA_INPUT_DESCRIPTION@

        Signal annotation: Please provide a list of m/z values of interest as csv file with ";" delimiter:
        - The column with a unique identifier for each mass of interest must be called "name".
        - The m/z value of interest must be provided as "mz".
        - The annotation file may contain any additional columns.

        ppm range: Provide the half-interval around the m/z values of interest where peaks are still considered part of the signal.

        subsample percentage: Set the percentage of pixels that are utilized for visualization. Changing this number helps adjust the readability of some graphs in the report.
